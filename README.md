== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why when i pick any content items it add unknown image as  the slideshow image? =
It means you content item has neither Featured Image no Image in content. If plugin doesn't find anything it uses the default image. You can replace image when adding or editing a slide.
= My page has an Image, but instead it plugin uses one from previous slideshow=
You try to add it too fast. To pick image plugin does additional request, as featured image doesn't included to post object, only its id.
